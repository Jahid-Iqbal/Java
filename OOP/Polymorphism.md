# Polymorphism

Poly+morphs= Many+ forms  
Just like water. Water has solid forms, Liquid forms, gas forms.

Two types of Polymorphism:  
1. Compile time/ Static Polymorphism:
    - Method overloading
    - Compiler managed

**Example:**  


2. Run time/ Dynamic Polymorphism: In case of overridden methods, which methods should be invoked that determines at run time. That's why it is called as Run time/ Dynamic polymorphism.
    - Method overriding
    - JVM managed
